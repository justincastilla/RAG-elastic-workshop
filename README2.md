## Navigating the Directory
This directory is subdivided into two sub directories samples and solutions. 
- **samples** sub directory contains small code samples and snippets which can be used to complete small sets of actions and can be integrated into the user code. 
- **solutions** sub directory contains solutions for some use cases and industry scenarios, which can be easily customized and built into full scale production systems.
